<!--

NOTES:

Good news:

* no media queries needed after all (for now)
* atomic/modular approach to the CSS with good namespacing means there shouldn't be any issues with other parts of the site, as far as I could test.

Bad news:

* atomic approach means lots of repetition in the CSS that could become technical debt to be addressed later. E.g. the coronavirus banner and author bio share a similar layout but almost no overlapping styles.
* making the entire coronavirus chapter marker into a link ended up being too hacky and unreliable, so I went with the longer layout with embedded links.
* for the virus icon - please remember to actually download and transfer the URL away from my personal S3 bucket
