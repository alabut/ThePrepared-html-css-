						<p class="intro"><strong>Your privacy is very important to us.</strong></p>
						<p>The Prepared does not:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Spam you.</li>
							<li>&ldquo;Out&rdquo; you.</li>
							<li>Sell your personal information.</li>
							<li>Work with third parties that sell your personal information, spam you, etc.</li>
							<li>Take any actions on your social media profiles (or any other third-party service) without your explicit permission.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You may use many of The Prepared’s public services without providing any information beyond the basic, standard things collected while browsing the web, such as your IP address, which browser you use (eg. Chrome or Safari), and if you’re on a desktop or mobile device. Cookies are used for industry-standard practices across our services, including remembering when you’re logged into your account and measuring how many readers see an article.</p>
						<p>When you choose to, we collect personal information solely for delivering our services to you. For example, you may give us your email address, password, username, picture, credit card information, name, billing address, or shipping address when choosing to buy something.</p>
						<p>Such info is stored securely and generally not accessible to anyone outside of The Prepared’s core staff. Exceptions are when it’s necessary to securely transmit info to third-party vendors for actions you take, such as a credit card processor.</p>
						<p>Any third-party vendors we work with (eg. Mailchimp for email newsletters) have strong data protection agreements and follow all laws, including GDPR, CCPA, and PCI compliance. Some of those partners require us to paste these italicized messages:</p>
						<p><em>GDPR and CCPA: We make every effort to comply with all privacy laws (and have helped write a few of those laws ourselves!) If you are subject to the GDPR or CCPA privacy laws, and any or all of The Prepared’s services (including third-party vendors) are not in compliance, then you may not use our services or you expressly waive any damages/recourse if you continue anyway. We are a small startup, please be kind.</em></p>
